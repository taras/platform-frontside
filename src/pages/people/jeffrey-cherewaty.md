bio: Jeffrey is a startup veteran who likes building thoughtfully designed apps in the browser. He wrote PHP in a past life, and still has scars from CSS layouts in IE6. These days heâ€™s all-in on modern JavaScript. Jeffrey believes in empathy, constant learning, and King Ranch chicken. His autobiography would be set in Futura and Sentinel.
