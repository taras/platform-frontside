bio: Joe is someone who is motivated by collaboration, creative problem-solving, and curiosity above all else.  He also happens to be a software developer.  He has produced pounds of Perl in Pittsburgh, ran with Rails and grappled with Go south of San Francisco, and has now settled in to author applications in Austin.  Joe is excited to hone his front-end skills with the fine people of the Frontside.  He's not usually this alliterative.
