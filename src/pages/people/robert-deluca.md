bio: Robert has been contributing to open source for almost as long as he has been writing code. As Director of Open Source & Community Engagement, Robert is in charge of making sure Frontsiders are engaging with the wider community & giving back where they can. When not contributing to open source, he enjoys designing great JavaScript powered user experiences by crafting them in CSS/SCSS and ensuring their accessibility. In his spare time, you can find Robert hanging out by the pool with his wife & dog, tinkering on home automation, & watching college football on Saturdays (go 'canes!).
