bio: Chris ended up developing software by accident. After getting degrees in Political Science and Economics, he worked as a data analyst before going to work on analytics software and realizing that programming is actually the best. He’s written open source software in R, Scala, and now Javascript, and basically just likes anything that involves a text editor and higher-order functions. In his spare time, he enjoys cooking, listening to podcasts, reading about other programming languages, and spending time with his fiancé and their (awesome) army of (awesome) cats.
