bio: Wil went to school in hopes of becoming a Graphic Designer but by the end realized his true passion was in development. He loves tackling tough challenges like finding solutions to UX problems or fixing complex, hard-to-solve bugs. What he loves most though is learning new things and he strongly believes that there is always more to learn no matter how much you already know about a subject. When he isn't slinging code, he's keeping up with the latest technologies, learning useless skills like solving Rubik's Cubes, or playing video games with his wife.
